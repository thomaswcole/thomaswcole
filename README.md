### Hi, my name is Thomas

I'm currently a graduate student at Columbia University, where Iâ€™m pursuing a masterâ€™s in mathematical finance. Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree at McGill University where I completed a major in mathematics and a minor in finance.

I'm passionate about applied mathematics and statistics, paritcularly with their applications to finance. You can read more about my current and past work [here](https://thomaswcole.github.io/)
