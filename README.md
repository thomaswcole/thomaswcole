### Hi, my name is Thomas


I recently compelted my undergraduate degree at McGill University where I compeleted a major in mathematics alongside a minor in finance. In Fall 2024, I will start my master's at Columbia University. 

I'm passionate about applied mathematics and statistics, paritcularly with their applications to finance. I recently completed a research project examining use of PCA as a means of demonsionality reduction on the implied volatility surface for US Equities.
